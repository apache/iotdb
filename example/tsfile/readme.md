# Function
```
The example is to show how to write and read a TsFile File.
```
# Usage
## Dependencies with Maven

```
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.iotdb</groupId>
        <artifactId>tsfile</artifactId>
     	  <version>0.13.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```


## Run TsFileWrite.java


  This class is to show how to write a TsFile. It provided two ways:
  
   The first one is using a JSON string for measurement(s). The JSON string is an array of JSON 
   objects(schema). The object must include the *measurement_id*, *datatype*, *encoding*, and 
   *compressor*. 
   
   An example JSON string is provided in the comments in 
   the method
   
        public static void tsFileWriteWithJson() throws IOException,WriteProcessException
   It uses this interface
   
        public void addMeasurementByJson(JSONObject measurement) throws WriteProcessException  
   An alternative way is to add these measurements directly(manually) by the second interface: 
   
         public void addMeasurement(MeasurementSchema measurementSchema) throws WriteProcessException
   
   The method
   
         public static void tsFileWriteDirect() throws IOException,WriteProcessException
   shows how to use that interface.
   
   Note that the measurements in the two methods are the same therefore there output TsFile should also be identical.


  
## Run TsFileRead.java

 This class is to show how to read TsFile file named "testDirect.tsfile".
 
 The TsFile file "testDirect.tsfile" is generated from class TsFileWrite.
 
 It generates the same TsFile(testDirect.tsfile and testWithJson.tsfile) file by two different ways
 
 Run TsFileWrite to generate the testDirect.tsfile first
 
## Run TsFileSequenceRead.java

  This class is to show the structure of a TsFile.
