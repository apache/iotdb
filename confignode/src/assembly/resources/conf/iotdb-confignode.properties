### Startup configuration
####################


# Used for cluster internal RPC communication.
# Could set 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1(for local test) or ipv4 address.
# Datatype: String
internal_address=0.0.0.0


# Used for cluster internal RPC communication
# Datatype: int
internal_port=22277


# Used for ConfigNodeGroup's ConsensusLayer interior communication
# Datatype: int
consensus_port=22278


# At least one running ConfigNode should be set for joining the cluster
# Format: ip:port
# where the ip should be consistent with the target ConfigNode's confignode_internal_address,
# and the port should be consistent with the target ConfigNode's confignode_internal_port.
# For the first ConfigNode to start, target_config_nodes points to its own internal_address:internal_port.
# For other ConfigNodes that are started or restarted, target_config_nodes points to any running ConfigNode's internal_address:internal_port.
# Notice: The ip for any target_config_node should never be 0.0.0.0
# Datatype: String

### Region configuration
####################


# SchemaRegion consensus protocol type.

# Datatype: String
# schema_region_consensus_protocol_class=org.apache.iotdb.consensus.standalone.StandAloneConsensus
