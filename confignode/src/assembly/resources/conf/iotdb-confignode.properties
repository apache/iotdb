### DeviceGroup Configuration
####################

# Number of DeviceGroups per StorageGroup
# Datatype: int
# device_group_count=10000

# DeviceGroup hash algorithm
# Datatype: String
# Currently, BKDR, AP, JS or SDBM hash algorithm is available
# device_group_hash_algorithm=BKDR

# DeviceGroupHashExecutor package name
# Datatype: String
# If you want to implement your own hash algorithm, you can inherit the DeviceGroupHashExecutor class and
# modify this parameter to correspond to your Java package prefix.
# But make sure that your own DeviceGroupHashExecutor class name is device_group_hash_algorithm + "HashExecutor".
# device_group_hash_executor_package=org.apache.iotdb.confignode.manager.hash.
