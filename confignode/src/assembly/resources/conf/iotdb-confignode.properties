# could set ip or hostname
# Datatype: String
internal_address=0.0.0.0


# Used for cluster internal RPC communication
# Datatype: int

# Used for ConfigNodeGroup's ConsensusLayer interior communication

# At least one running ConfigNode should be set for joining the cluster
# Format: ip:port
# where the ip should be consistent with the target ConfigNode's confignode_internal_address,

### Region configuration
####################


# SchemaRegion consensus protocol type.
# This parameter is unmodifiable after ConfigNode starts for the first time.
# These consensus protocols are currently supported:
# 1. org.apache.iotdb.consensus.standalone.StandAloneConsensus(Consensus patterns optimized specifically for single replica)

# Datatype: String
# schema_region_consensus_protocol_class=org.apache.iotdb.consensus.standalone.StandAloneConsensus

# The maximum number of SchemaRegion expected to be managed by each DataNode.
# Notice: Since each StorageGroup requires at least one SchemaRegion to manage it's schema,
# this parameter doesn't limit the number of SchemaRegions when there are too many StorageGroups.

# DataRegion consensus protocol type.
# This parameter is unmodifiable after ConfigNode starts for the first time.
# These consensus protocols are currently supported:
