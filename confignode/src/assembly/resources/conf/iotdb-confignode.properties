### consensus protocol configuration
####################

# 
# Datatype: String
# consensus_class=org.apache.iotdb.consensus.standalone.StandAloneConsensus

# Used for building the ConfigNode consensus group
# all config node address and internal port, use comma to distinguish

### DeviceGroup Configuration
####################

# Number of DeviceGroups per StorageGroup
# Datatype: int
# device_group_count=10000

# DeviceGroup hash algorithm
# Datatype: String
# These hashing algorithms are currently supported:
# 1. org.apache.iotdb.commons.hash.BKDRHashExecutor(Default)
# 2. org.apache.iotdb.commons.hash.APHashExecutor
# 3. org.apache.iotdb.commons.hash.JSHashExecutor
# 4. org.apache.iotdb.commons.hash.SDBMHashExecutor
# Also, if you want to implement your own hash algorithm, you can inherit the DeviceGroupHashExecutor class and
# modify this parameter to correspond to your Java class
# device_group_hash_executor_class=org.apache.iotdb.commons.hash.BKDRHashExecutor

### Directory Configuration
####################

# system dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/system).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# system_dir=data\\system
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# system_dir=data/system


# data dirs
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/data).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# Note: If data_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# data_dirs=data\\data
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
