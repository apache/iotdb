### Config Node RPC Configuration
####################


# Used for cluster internal RPC communication.
# Could set 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1(for local test) or ipv4 address.
# Datatype: String
cn_internal_address=0.0.0.0


# Used for cluster internal RPC communication
# Datatype: int
cn_internal_port=22277


# Used for ConfigNodeGroup's ConsensusLayer interior communication
# Datatype: int
cn_consensus_port=22278

####################
### Target Config Nodes
####################

# At least one running ConfigNode should be set for joining the cluster
# Format: ip:port
# where the ip should be consistent with the target ConfigNode's confignode_internal_address,
# and the port should be consistent with the target ConfigNode's confignode_internal_port.
# For the first ConfigNode to start, target_config_nodes points to its own internal_address:internal_port.
# For other ConfigNodes that are started or restarted, target_config_nodes points to any running ConfigNode's internal_address:internal_port.
# Notice: The ip for any target_config_node should never be 0.0.0.0
# Datatype: String
cn_target_config_nodes=127.0.0.1:22277

### Directory configuration
####################


# system dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the confignode folder(i.e., %CONFIGNODE_HOME%/data/confignode/system).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the confignode folder.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# cn_system_dir=data\\confignode\\system
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# cn_system_dir=data/confignode/system


# consensus dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the confignode folder(i.e., %CONFIGNODE_HOME%/data/confignode/consensus).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the confignode folder.
# Note: If data_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# cn_consensus_dir=data\\confignode\\consensus
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
