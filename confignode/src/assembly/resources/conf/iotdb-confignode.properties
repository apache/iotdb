### Directory Configuration
####################

# system dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the confignode folder(i.e., %CONFIGNODE_HOME%/data/system).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the confignode folder.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# system_dir=data\\system
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.

# data dirs
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the confignode folder(i.e., %CONFIGNODE_HOME%/data/data).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the confignode folder.
# Note: If data_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.

### StorageGroup Configuration
####################

# also be affected. And negative values are accepted, which means you can only insert future data.
