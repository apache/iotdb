### Startup configuration
####################


# could set ip or hostname
# Datatype: String
rpc_address=0.0.0.0


# Used for cluster internal RPC communication
# Datatype: int
rpc_port=22277


# Used for ConfigNodeGroup's ConsensusLayer interior communication
# Datatype: int
consensus_port=22278


# Used for connecting to the ConfigNodeGroup
# Format: ip:rpc_port:consensus_port
# where the ip should be consistent with the target ConfigNode's confignode_rpc_address,
# and the port should be consistent with the target ConfigNode's confignode_rpc_port and confignode_consensus_port.
# For the first ConfigNode to start, config_nodes points to its own ip:port.
# For other ConfigNodes that are started or restarted, config_nodes points to any running ConfigNode's ip:rpc_port:consensus_port.
# Datatype: String

### Consensus protocol configuration
####################

# All parameters in Consensus protocol configuration is unmodifiable after ConfigNode starts for the first time.
# And these parameters should be consistent within the ConfigNodeGroup.

# DataRegion consensus protocol type
# These consensus protocols are currently supported:
# 1. org.apache.iotdb.consensus.standalone.StandAloneConsensus(Consensus patterns optimized specifically for single replica)
# 2. org.apache.iotdb.consensus.ratis.RatisConsensus(Raft protocol)
# 3. org.apache.iotdb.consensus.multileader.MultiLeaderConsensus(weak consistency, high performance)
# Datatype: String
# data_region_consensus_protocol_class=org.apache.iotdb.consensus.standalone.StandAloneConsensus

# SchemaRegion consensus protocol type
# These consensus protocols are currently supported:
# 1. org.apache.iotdb.consensus.standalone.StandAloneConsensus(Consensus patterns optimized specifically for single replica)
# 2. org.apache.iotdb.consensus.ratis.RatisConsensus(Raft protocol)
