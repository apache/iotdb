### DeviceGroup Configuration
####################

# Number of DeviceGroups per StorageGroup
# Datatype: int
# device_group_count=10000

# DeviceGroup hash algorithm
# Datatype: String
# These hashing algorithms are currently supported:
# 1. org.apache.iotdb.confignode.manager.hash.BKDRHashExecutor(Default)
# 2. org.apache.iotdb.confignode.manager.hash.APHashExecutor
# 3. org.apache.iotdb.confignode.manager.hash.JSHashExecutor
# 4. org.apache.iotdb.confignode.manager.hash.SDBMHashExecutor
# Also, if you want to implement your own hash algorithm, you can inherit the DeviceGroupHashExecutor class and
# modify this parameter to correspond to your Java class
# device_group_hash_executor_class=org.apache.iotdb.confignode.manager.hash.BKDRHashExecutor
