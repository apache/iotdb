Apache IoTDB (Database for Internet of Things) is an IoT native database with high performance for 
data management and analysis, deployable on the edge and the cloud. Due to its light-weight 
architecture, high performance and rich feature set together with its deep integration with 
Apache Hadoop, Spark and Flink, Apache IoTDB can meet the requirements of massive data storage, 
high-speed data ingestion and complex data analysis in the IoT industrial fields.

# Apache IoTDB Node.js Client API

Using the package, you can write data to IoTDB, read data from IoTDB and maintain the schema of IoTDB.

## How to use (Example)

First, download the package: `pip3 install apache-iotdb`

You can get an example of using the package to read and write data at here: [Example](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/rel/0.11/client-py/src/SessionExample.py)

(you need to add `import iotdb` in the head of the file)

Or:

```javascript

const session = require('Session')
const s = new session.Session("127.0.0.1", 6667);
s.open(false).then(r => s.close())

```

### Compile the thrift library and Debug

In the root of IoTDB's source code folder,  run `mvn clean generate-sources -pl client-nodejs -am`.

This will automatically delete and repopulate the folder `iotdb/thrift` with the generated thrift files.
This folder is ignored from git and should **never be pushed to git!**

**Notice** Do not upload `iotdb/thrift` to the git repo.
