# consistency level, now three consistency levels are supported: strong, mid and weak.
# Strong consistency means the server will first try to synchronize with the leader to get the

# but if failed(timeout), it will give up and just use current data it has cached before;
# Weak consistency do not synchronize with the leader and simply use the local data
