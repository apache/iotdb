/**
 * PipeConnector
 *
 * <p>PipeConnector is responsible for sending events to sinks.
 *
 * <p>Various network protocols can be supported by implementing different PipeConnector classes.
 *
 * <p>The lifecycle of a PipeConnector is as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When a collaboration task is created, the KV pairs of `WITH CONNECTOR` clause in SQL are
 *       parsed and the validation method {@link PipeConnector#validate(PipeParameterValidator)}
 *       will be called to validate the parameters.
 *   <li>Before the collaboration task starts, the method {@link
 *       PipeConnector#customize(PipeParameters, PipeConnectorRuntimeConfiguration)} will be called
 *       to config the runtime behavior of the PipeConnector and the method {@link
 *       PipeConnector#handshake()} will be called to create a connection with sink.
 *   <li>While the collaboration task is in progress:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>PipeExtractor captures the events and wraps them into three types of Event instances.
 *         <li>PipeProcessor processes the event and then passes them to the PipeConnector.
 *         <li>PipeConnector serializes the events into binaries and send them to sinks. The
 *             following 3 methods will be called: {@link
 *             PipeConnector#transfer(TabletInsertionEvent)}, {@link
 *             PipeConnector#transfer(TsFileInsertionEvent)} and {@link
 *             PipeConnector#transfer(Event)}.
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>When the collaboration task is cancelled (the `DROP PIPE` command is executed), the {@link
 *       PipeConnector#close() } method will be called.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition, the method {@link PipeConnector#heartbeat()} will be called periodically to check
 * whether the connection with sink is still alive. The method {@link PipeConnector#handshake()}
 * will be called to create a new connection with the sink when the method {@link
 * PipeConnector#heartbeat()} throws exceptions.
