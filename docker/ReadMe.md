# Docker image version definition

Before v0.12, Apache IoTDB's docker image name and version format is:
`apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>`.

From 0.12 on, we release two images: one is for a single node, and the other is for the cluster mode.
The format is: `apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>-node` and `apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>-cluster`.

## The definition of tag "latest"
Before v0.12, the "latest" tag will forward to the largest `apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>`.

From 0.12 on, the "latest" tag will forward to the largest `apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>-node`.


# How to build

docker build -t THE_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:THE_VERSION -f THE_DOCKER_FILE_NAME

e.g.,

```shell
docker build -t my-iotdb:<version> -f Dockerfile-<version>
```

# How to run IoTDB server 

Actually, we maintain a repo on dockerhub, so that you can get the docker image directly.

For example,

```shell
docker run -d -p 6667:6667 -p 31999:31999 -p 8181:8181 -p 5555:5555 apache/iotdb:<version>
```

```shell
docker run -d -p 6667:6667 -p 31999:31999 -p 8181:8181 -p 5555:5555 -p 9003:9003 -p 40010:40010 apache/iotdb:<version>
```

## Port description

By default, the ports that IoTDB uses are:

* 6667: RPC port
* 31999: JMX port
* 8086: InfluxDB Protocol port
* 8181: Monitor port
* 5555: Data sync port
* 9003: internal metadata rpc port (for cluster)
* 40010: internal data rpc port (for cluster)


## How to configure docker volumes

The instructions below show how to store the output data and logs of IoTDB to two folders called 
iotdb_data and iotdb_logs respectively. 

`/D/docker/iotdb_data` and `/D/docker/iotdb_logs` can be changed to any local directory of your own host.

```shell
docker run -it -v /D/docker/iotdb_data:/iotdb/data -v /D/docker/iotdb_logs:/iotdb/logs --name 123 apache/iotdb:<version>
```

# How to run IoTDB client

Suppose you have run an IoTDB Server in docker

1. Use `docker ps` to find out the CONTAINER ID
e.g.,
   
```shell
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                NAMES
c82321c70137        apache/iotdb:<version>  "/iotdb/sbin/start-sâ€¦"   12 minutes ago      Up 12 minutes       0.0.0.0:6667->6667/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8181->8181/tcp, 5555/tcp, 0.0.0.0:31999->31999/tcp   elegant_germain
```
2. Use `docker exec` to attach the container:

```shell
docker exec -it c82321c70137 /bin/bash
```

Then, for the latest version (or, >=0.10.x), run `start-cli.sh`, for version 0.9.x and 0.8.1, run `start-client.sh`.

Or, 

```shell
docker exec -it c82321c70137 start-cli.sh
```

# How to run IoTDB-grafana-connector

1. First way: use config file:

```
docker run -it -v /your_application.properties_folder:/iotdb-grafana-connector/config -p 8888:8888 apache/iotdb:<version>-grafana
```

2. Second way: use environment(take `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` for example)

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 apache/iotdb:<version>-grafana -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:iotdb://iotdb:6667/
```

3. All related environment are as follows(more details in `grafana/src/main/resources/application.properties`)

| name                                | default value                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

| SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD          | root                              |
| SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME | org.apache.iotdb.jdbc.IoTDBDriver |
| SERVER_PORT                         | 8888                              |

# How to run IoTDB-grafana-connector by docker compose
> Using docker compose, it contains three services: iotdb, grafana and grafana-connector

1. The location of docker compose file: `/docker/src/main/DockerCompose/docker-compose-grafana.yml`
2. Use `docker-compose up` can start all three services
   1. you can use `docker-compose up -d` to start in the background
   2. you can modify `docker-compose-grafana.yml` to implement your requirements.
      1. you can modify environment of grafana-connector
      2. If you want to **SAVE ALL DATA**, please use `volumes` keyword to mount the data volume or file of the host into the container.
3. After all services are start, you can visit `{ip}:3000` to visit grafana
   1. In `Configuration`, search `SimpleJson`
   2. Fill in url: `grafana-connector:8888`, then click `save and test`. if `Data source is working` is shown, the configuration is finished.
   3. Then you can create dashboards.
4. if you want to stop services, just run `docker-compose down`

Enjoy it!
