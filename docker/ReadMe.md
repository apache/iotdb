# Docker image version definition

Before v0.12, Apache IoTDB's docker image name and version format is:
`apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>`.

From 0.12 on, we release two images: one is for a single node, and the other is for the cluster mode.
The format is: `apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>-node` and `apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>-cluster`.

## The definition of tag "latest"
Before v0.12, the "latest" tag will forward to the largest `apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>`.

From 0.12 on, the "latest" tag will forward to the largest `apache/iotdb:0.<major>.<minor>-node`.


# How to build

docker build -t THE_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:THE_VERSION -f THE_DOCKER_FILE_NAME

e.g.,

```shell
docker build -t my-iotdb:<version> -f Dockerfile-<version>
```

# How to run IoTDB server 

Actually, we maintain a repo on dockerhub, so that you can get the docker image directly.

For example,

```shell
docker run -d -p 6667:6667 -p 31999:31999 -p 8181:8181 -p 5555:5555 apache/iotdb:<version>
```

```shell
docker run -d -p 6667:6667 -p 31999:31999 -p 8181:8181 -p 5555:5555 -p 9003:9003 -p 40010:40010 apache/iotdb:<version>
```

## Port description

By default, the ports that IoTDB uses are:

* 6667: RPC port
* 31999: JMX port
* 8181: Monitor port
* 5555: Data sync port
* 9003: internal metadata rpc port (for cluster)
* 40010: internal data rpc port (for cluster)


## How to configure docker volumes

The instructions below show how to store the output data and logs of IoTDB to two folders called 
iotdb_data and iotdb_logs respectively. 

`/D/docker/iotdb_data` and `/D/docker/iotdb_logs` can be changed to any local directory of your own host.

```shell
docker run -it -v /D/docker/iotdb_data:/iotdb/data -v /D/docker/iotdb_logs:/iotdb/logs --name 123 apache/iotdb:<version>
```

# How to run IoTDB client

Suppose you have run an IoTDB Server in docker

1. Use `docker ps` to find out the CONTAINER ID
e.g.,
   
```shell
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                NAMES
c82321c70137        apache/iotdb:<version>  "/iotdb/sbin/start-sâ€¦"   12 minutes ago      Up 12 minutes       0.0.0.0:6667->6667/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8181->8181/tcp, 5555/tcp, 0.0.0.0:31999->31999/tcp   elegant_germain
```
2. Use `docker exec` to attach the container:

```shell
docker exec -it c82321c70137 /bin/bash
```

Then, for the latest version (or, >=0.10.x), run `start-cli.sh`, for version 0.9.x and 0.8.1, run `start-client.sh`.

Or, 

```shell
docker exec -it c82321c70137 start-cli.sh
```

Enjoy it!
