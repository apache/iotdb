# Execution plan generator

* org.apache.iotdb.db.qp.Planner

Transform the syntax tree parsed by SQL into logical plans, logical optimizations, and physical plans.

## SQL  parsing

SQL parsing using Antlr4

* antlr/src/main/antlr4/org/apache/iotdb/db/qp/strategy/SqlBase.g4

`mvn clean compile -pl antlr` 

Generated code location ï¼šantlr/target/generated-sources/antlr4

## Logical plan generator

* org.apache.iotdb.db.qp.strategy.LogicalGenerator

## Logical plan optimizer

There are currently three logical plan optimizers

* org.apache.iotdb.db.qp.strategy.optimizer.ConcatPathOptimizer

  The path optimizer splices query paths in SQL, interacts with MManager, removes wildcards, and performs path checking.

* org.apache.iotdb.db.qp.strategy.optimizer.RemoveNotOptimizer

  The predicate de-optimizer removes the non-operators in the predicate logic.

* org.apache.iotdb.db.qp.strategy.optimizer.DnfFilterOptimizer

  Turn predicates into disjunctive normal form.

* org.apache.iotdb.db.qp.strategy.optimizer.MergeSingleFilterOptimizer

  Combine predicates of the same path logically.

## Physical plan generator

* org.apache.iotdb.db.qp.strategy.PhysicalGenerator
