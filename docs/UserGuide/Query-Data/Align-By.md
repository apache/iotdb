# Query Alignment Mode

In addition, IoTDB supports another result set format: `ALIGN BY DEVICE`.

## align by device

The `ALIGN BY DEVICE` indicates that the deviceId is considered as a column. Therefore, there are totally limited columns in the dataset. 

> NOTEï¼š
> 
> 1.You can see the result of 'align by device' as one relational table, `Time + Device` is the primary key of this Table. 
>
> 2.The result is order by `Device` firstly, and then by `Time` order.

The SQL statement is:

```sql
select * from root.ln.** where time <= 2017-11-01T00:01:00 align by device;
```

The result shows below:

```
+-----------------------------+-----------------+-----------+------+--------+
|                         Time|           Device|temperature|status|hardware|
