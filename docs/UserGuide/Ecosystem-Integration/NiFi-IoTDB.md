### Inferred Schema of Flowfile

There are a couple of rules about flowfile:

1. The flowfile can be read by `Record Reader`.
2. The schema of flowfile must contain a field `Time`, and it must be the first.
3. The data type of time must be `STRING` or `LONG`.
4. Fields excepted time must start with `root.`.
5. The supported data types are `INT`, `LONG`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOLEAN`, `TEXT`.

### Convert Schema by property

As mentioned above, converting schema by property which is more flexible and stronger than inferred schema. 

The structure of property `Schema`:

```json
{
	"timeType": "LONG",
	"fields": [{
		"tsName": "s1",
		"dataType": "INT32",
		"encoding": "RLE",
		"compressionType": "GZIP"
	}, {
		"tsName": "s2",
		"dataType": "INT64",
		"encoding": "RLE",
		"compressionType": "GZIP"
	}]
}
```

**Note**

1. The first column must be `Time`. The rest must be arranged in the same order as in `field` of JSON.
1. The JSON of schema must contain `timeType` and `fields`.
2. There are only two options `LONG` and `STRING` for `timeType`.
3. The columns `tsName` and `dataType` must be set.
4. The property `Prefix` will be added to tsName as the field name when add data to IoTDB.
5. The supported `dataTypes` are `INT32`, `INT64`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOLEAN`, `TEXT`.
6. The supported `encoding` are `PLAIN`, `DICTIONARY`, `RLE`, `DIFF`, `TS_2DIFF`, `BITMAP`, `GORILLA_V1`, `REGULAR`, `GORILLA`.
7. The supported `compressionType` are `UNCOMPRESSED`, `SNAPPY`, `GZIP`, `LZO`, `SDT`, `PAA`, `PLA`, `LZ4`.

## QueryIoTDBRecord

This is a processor that reads the sql query from the incoming FlowFile and using it to query the result from IoTDB using native interface. Then it use the configured 'Record Writer' to generate the flowfile
