DBeaver is a SQL client software application and a database administration tool. It can use the JDBC application programming interface (API) to interact with IoTDB via the JDBC driver. 

### DBeaver Installation

* From DBeaver site: https://dbeaver.io/download/

### IoTDB Installation

* Download binary version
  * From IoTDB site: https://iotdb.apache.org/Download/
  * Version >= 0.13.0
* Or compile from source code
  * See https://github.com/apache/iotdb
