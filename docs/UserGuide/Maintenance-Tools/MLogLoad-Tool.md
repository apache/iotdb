## MLogLoad Tool 

### Introduction

The MLogLoad tool  is used to load the metadata from `mlog.bin` and tags and attributes from `tlog.txt` into the running IoTDB.
Data to be loaded that conflicts with metadata in the running IoTDB will be skipped.

### How to Use

Linux/MacOS

> ./mLogLoad.sh -mlog /yourpath/mlog.bin -tlog /yourpath/tlog.txt -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root

Windows

> ./mLogLoad.bat -mlog /yourpath/mlog.bin -tlog /yourpath/tlog.txt -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root

```
usage: MLogLoad -mlog <mlog file> [-tlog <tlog file>] [-h <receiver host>]
       [-p <receiver port>] [-u <user>] [-pw <password>] [-help]
 -mlog <mlog file>    Need to specify a binary mlog.bin file to parse
                      (required)
 -tlog <tlog file>    Could specify a binary tlog.txt file to parse. Tags
                      and attributes will be ignored if not specified
                      (optional)
 -h <receiver host>   Could specify a specify the receiver host, default
                      is 127.0.0.1 (optional)
 -p <receiver port>   Could specify a specify the receiver port, default
                      is 6667 (optional)
 -u <user>            Could specify the user name, default is root
                      (optional)
 -pw <password>       Could specify the password, default is root
                      (optional)
 -help,--help         Display help information
```

Note: If tlog is not specified, the MLogLoad tool will ignore tags and attributes management.

### Example

The purpose is to load the local metadata file `/yourpath/mlog.bin` into IoTDB instance running on server 192.168.0.101:6667.

Enter to the directory where mLogLoad.sh is located and execute the following statement:

```
./mLogLoad.sh -mlog "/yourpath/mlog.bin" -h 192.168.0.101 -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```

After waiting for the script execution to complete, you can check that the metadata in the IoTDB instance has been loaded correctly.

### Q&A

* Cannot find or load the main class MLoadLoader
  * It may be because the environment variable $IOTDB_HOME is not set, please set the environment variable and try again
