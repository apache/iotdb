## Export Schema

The schema export operation exports the information about store group, timeseries, and schema template in the current IoTDB in the form of `mlog.bin` and `tlog.txt` to the specified directory.

The exported `mlog.bin` and `tlog.txt` files can be incrementally loaded into an IoTDB instance.

### Export Schema with SQL

```
EXPORT SCHEMA '<path/dir>'

* Cannot find or load the main class ExportSchema
    * It may be because the environment variable $IOTDB_HOME is not set, please set the environment variable and try again
* Encounter an error, because: File ... already exist.
    * There is already a mlog.bin or tlog.txt file in the target directory, please check the target directory and try again
