## Cluster Setup

This article is the setup process of IoTDB Cluster (0.14.0-preview1).

## Environments

1. JDK>=1.8

2. Max open file 65535

3. Disable the swap memory

## Get the binary distribution

### Download

Download the binary distribution from website [Download Page](https://iotdb.apache.org/Download/)

### Compiled from source code

Download the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/iotdb.git
```

The default branch is master, you could checkout to the release tag:

```
git checkout v0.14.0-preview1
```

Under the source root folder:

```
mvn clean package -pl distribution -am -DskipTests
```

Then you will get the binary distribution under **distribution/target**, in which the **all-bin** contains ConfigNode and DataNodeï¼Œand DataNode contains the Cli.

## Binary Distribution Content

| **Folder** | **Description**                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| confignode |  Contains start/stop shell, configurations, logs, data of ConfigNode |
| datanode   | Contains start/stop shell, configurations, logs, data of DataNode, cli shell|
| grafana-metrics-example  | Grafana metric page module           |
| lib      | Jar files folder                                     |
| tools    | System tools                                   |

## Start the Cluster

Users could start a cluster which contains multiple ConfigNode and DataNode.
A cluster need at least one ConfigNode and no less than the number of data/schema_replication_factor DataNodes.

The total process are three steps:

* Start the first ConfigNode
* Add ConfigNode (Optional)
* Add DataNode

### Start the first ConfigNode

Important parameters in iotdb-confignode.properties:

| **Configuration** | **Description**                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| rpc\_address    | Internal rpc service address of ConfigNode          |
| rpc\_port    | Internal rpc service address of ConfigNode       |
| consensus\_port    | ConfigNode replication consensus protocol communication port    |
| config\_nodes    | Target ConfigNode address, if the current is the first ConfigNode, then set its address:port    |
| data\_replication\_factor  | Data replication factor, no more than DataNode number        |
| data\_region\_consensus\_protocol\_class | Consensus protocol of data replicas |
| schema\_replication\_factor  | Schema replication factor, no more than DataNode number       |
| schema\_region\_consensus\_protocol\_class   | Consensus protocol of schema replicas |

More details  [ConfigNode Configurations](https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/Reference/ConfigNode-Config-Manual.html)

### Add ConfigNode (Optional)

This will add the replication factor of ConfigNode, except for the port couldn't conflict, make sure other configurations are the same with existing ConfigNode in Cluster.

### Start DataNode

You could add any number of DataNode.

Important parameters in iotdb-datanode.properties

| **Configuration** | **Description**                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| rpc\_address    | Client RPC Service address         |
| rpc\_port    | Client RPC Service port           |
| internal\_address    | Control flow address of DataNode inside cluster         |
| internal\_port    | Control flow port of DataNode inside cluster           |
| mpp\_data\_exchange\_port    | Data flow port of DataNode inside cluster           |
| data\_region\_consensus\_port    | Data replicas communication port for consensus     |
| schema\_region\_consensus\_port    | Schema replicas communication port for consensus          |
| config\_nodes    | Running ConfigNode of the Cluster      |
