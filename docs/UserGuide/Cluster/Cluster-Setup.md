## Cluster setup

You can follow this document to start an IoTDB cluster.

## Prerequisite
To use IoTDB, you need to have:

1. Java >= 1.8 (Please make sure the environment path has been set)

2. Set the max open files num as 65535 to avoid "too many open files" problem.

   

## Installation

IoTDB provides you three installation methods, you can refer to the following suggestions, choose one of them:

- Installation from source code. If you need to modify the code yourself, you can use this method.
- Installation from binary files. Download the binary files from the  official website. 
- Using Docker：The path to the dockerfile is [github](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/master/docker/src/main)

### Build from source

You can download the source code from:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/iotdb.git
```

The default dev branch is the master branch, If you want to use a released version, for example:

```
git checkout rel/0.12
```

Under the root path of iotdb:

```
> mvn clean package -pl cluster -am -DskipTests
```

Then the cluster binary version can be found at **cluster/target/{iotdb-project.version}**

### Download

You can download the binary file from: [Download Page](https://iotdb.apache.org/Download/)



## Directory

After installation, the following directories will be generated by default under the root directory of the iotdb cluster:

| Directory | **Description**                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| conf      | Configuration file directory                                 |
| data      | Default data file directory, which can be modified in the configuration file |
| ext       | Default udf directory, which can be modified in the configuration file |
| lib       | Library directory                                            |
| logs      | Execution log directory                                      |
| sbin      | Script directory                                             |
| tools     | System tool directory                                        |



## Configurations

Before starting to use IoTDB, you need to config the configuration files first. For your convenience, we have already set the default config in the files. 

In total, we provide users four kinds of configurations module:

- environment configuration file (`iotdb-env.bat`, `iotdb-env.sh`). The default configuration file for the environment configuration item. Users can configure the relevant system configuration items of JAVA-JVM in the file.
- system configuration file (`iotdb-engine.properties`). The default configuration file for the IoTDB engine layer configuration item. Users can configure the IoTDB engine related parameters in the file, such as the precision of timestamp(`timestamp_precision`), etc. What's more, Users can configure settings of TsFile (the data files), such as the data size written to the disk per time(`group_size_in_byte`).
- log configuration file (`logback.xml`). The default log configuration file, such as the log levels.
- `iotdb-cluster.properties`. Some configurations required by IoTDB cluster. Such as replication number(`default_replica_num`), etc.

For detailed description of the two configuration files `iotdb-engine.properties`, `iotdb-env.sh`/`iotdb-env.bat`, please refer to [Configuration Manual](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/master/docs/UserGuide/Appendix/Config-Manual.md). The configuration items of IoTDB cluster are in the `iotdb-cluster.properties` file, you can also review the comments in the [configuration file](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/master/cluster/src/assembly/resources/conf/iotdb-cluster.properties) directly or you can refer to [Cluster Configuration](#Cluster Configuration).

Configuration files are located at **{cluster\_root\_dir}/conf**

**You are necessary to modify the following configuration items of each node to start your IoTDB cluster**：

* iotdb-engine.properties:

  * rpc\_address

  - rpc\_port

  - base\_dir

  - data\_dirs

  - wal\_dir

* iotdb-cluster.properties
  * internal\_ip
  * internal\_meta\_port
  * internal\_data\_port
  * cluster\_info\_public\_port
  * seed\_nodes

  * default\_replica\_num

### OverWrite the configurations of Stand-alone node

Some configurations in the iotdb-engines.properties will be ignored

- `enable_auto_create_schema` is always considered as `false`. Use `enable_auto_create_schema` in iotdb-cluster.properties to enable it, instead.

- `is_sync_enable` is always considered as `false`.

  

## Start Service

### Start Cluster

You can deploy a distributed cluster on multiple nodes or on a single machine, the main difference being that the latter needs to handle  conflicts between ports and file directories. For detail descriptions, please refer to [Configurations](#Configurations).

To start the service of one of the nodes, you need to execute the following commands:

```
# Unix/OS X
> nohup sbin/start-node.sh [printgc] [<conf_path>] >/dev/null 2>&1 &

# Windows
> sbin\start-node.bat [printgc] [<conf_path>]
```

`printgc` means whether enable the gc and print gc logs when start the node,
 `<conf_path>` use the configuration file in the `conf_path` folder to override the default configuration file.

**If you start all the seed nodes, and all the seed nodes can contact each other without ip/port and file directory conflicts, the cluster has successfully started.**

### Cluster scalability

In the process of cluster running, users can add new nodes to the cluster or delete existing nodes. At present, it only supports node by node cluster scalability, and multi node cluster scalability can be transformed into a series of single node cluster scalability operations. The cluster will hanlde new cluster extension operations only after the last cluster scalability operation is completed.

**Start the following script on the new node to join the cluster to add a new node:**

```
# Unix/OS X
> nohup sbin/add-node.sh [printgc] [<conf_path>] >/dev/null 2>&1 &
;
# Windows
> sbin\add-node.bat [printgc] [<conf_path>] 
```

`printgc` means whether enable the gc and print gc logs when start the node,
 `<conf_path>` use the configuration file in the `conf_path` folder to override the default configuration file. GC log is off by default.  For performance tuning, you may want to collect the GC info. GC log is stored at `IOTDB_HOME/logs/gc.log`.

**Start the following script on any node in the cluster to delete a node:**

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/remove-node.sh <internal_ip> <internal_meta_port>

# Windows
> sbin\remove-node.bat <internal_ip> <internal_meta_port>
```

`internal_ip` means the IP address of the node to be deleted `internal_meta_port` means the meta port of the node to be deleted

### Use Cli

please refer to [QuickStart](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/master/docs/UserGuide/QuickStart/QuickStart.md). You can establish a connection with any node in the cluster according to the rpc\_address and rpc\_port.

### **Stop Cluster**

To stop the services of all the nodes on a single machine, you need to execute the following commands:

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/stop-node.sh

# Windows
> sbin\stop-node.bat
```
