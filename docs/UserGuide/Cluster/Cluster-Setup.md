__NOTICE: CURRENT IoTDB CLUSTER IS FOR TESTING NOW! 
PLEASE BE DELIBERATE IF YOU RUN IT IN PRODUCT ENVIRONMENT.__

# Cluster Setup
For installation prerequisites, please refer to [QuickStart](../QuickStart/QuickStart.md)
## Prerequisite
Note: Please install MinGW or WSL or git bash if you are using Windows.
## Start Service
Users can build clusters in pseudo-distributed mode or distributed mode. 
The main difference between pseudo-distributed mode and distributed mode is the difference in `seed_nodes` in the configuration file. 
For detail descriptions, please refer to [Cluster Configuration Items](#Cluster Configuration Items).

To start the service of one of the nodes, you need to execute the following commands:

```bash
# Unix/OS X
> nohup sbin/start-node.sh [printgc] [<conf_path>] >/dev/null 2>&1 &

# Windows
> sbin\start-node.bat [printgc] [<conf_path>]
```
`printgc` means whether enable the gc and print gc logs when start the node,  
`<conf_path>` use the configuration file in the `conf_path` folder to override the default configuration file.

## OverWrite the configurations of Stand-alone node

Some configurations in the iotdb-engines.properties will be ignored

* `enable_auto_create_schema` is always considered as `false`. Use `enable_auto_create_schema` in 
 iotdb-cluster.properties to enable it, instead.

* `is_sync_enable` is always considered as `false`.

## Cluster Configuration Items
Before starting to use IoTDB, you need to config the configuration files first. 
For your convenience, we have already set the default config in the files.

In total, we provide users four kinds of configurations module: 

* environment configuration file (`iotdb-env.bat`, `iotdb-env.sh`). 
The default configuration file for the environment configuration item. 
Users can configure the relevant system configuration items of JAVA-JVM in the file.

* system configuration file (`iotdb-engine.properties`). The default configuration file for the IoTDB engine layer configuration item. 
Users can configure the IoTDB engine related parameters in the file, such as the precision of timestamp(`timestamp_precision`), etc. 
What's more, Users can configure settings of TsFile (the data files), such as the data size written to the disk per time(`group_size_in_byte`). 

* log configuration file (`logback.xml`). The default log configuration file, such as the log levels.

* `iotdb-cluster.properties`. Some configurations required by IoTDB cluster. Such as replication number(`default_replica_num`), etc.

For detailed description of the two configuration files `iotdb-engine.properties`, `iotdb-env.sh`/`iotdb-env.bat`, please refer to [Configuration Manual](../Appendix/Config-Manual.md). 
The configuration items described below are in the `iotdb-cluster.properties` file, you can also review the comments in the [configuration file](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/master/cluster/src/assembly/resources/conf/iotdb-cluster.properties) directly.

* internal\_meta\_port

|Name|internal\_meta\_port|

* seed\_nodes

|Name|seed\_nodes|
|:---:|:---|
|Description|The address of the nodes in the cluster, `{IP/DOMAIN}:internal_meta_port` format, separated by commas; for the pseudo-distributed mode, you can fill in `localhost`, or `127.0.0.1` or mixed, but the real ip address cannot appear; for the distributed mode, real ip or hostname is supported, but `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` cannot appear. When used by `start-node.sh(.bat)`, this configuration means the nodes that will form the initial cluster, so every node that use `start-node.sh(.bat)` should have the same `seed_nodes`, or the building of the initial cluster will fail. WARNING: if the initial cluster is built, this should not be changed before the environment is cleaned. When used by `add-node.sh(.bat)`, this means the nodes to which that the application of joining the cluster will be sent, as all nodes can respond to a request, this configuration can be any nodes that already in the cluster, unnecessary to be the nodes that were used to build the initial cluster by `start-node.sh(.bat)`. Several nodes will be picked randomly to send the request, the number of nodes picked depends on the number of retries.|

## Enable GC log
GC log is off by default.
For performance tuning, you may want to collect the GC info. 

To enable GC log, just add a parameter `printgc` when you start the server.

```bash
nohup sbin/start-node.sh printgc >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```
Or
```bash
sbin\start-node.bat printgc
```

GC log is stored at `IOTDB_HOME/logs/gc.log`.
