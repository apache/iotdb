## Example of distributed scaffolding for 3 nodes and 3 replicas

Suppose we need to deploy the distributed IoTDB on three physical nodes, A, B, and C, whose public network IP is a_public_IP, b_public_IP, and c_public_IP, and private network IP is a_private_IP, b_private_IP, and c_private_IP.
Note: If there is no public network IP or private network IP, both can be set to the same, just need to ensure that the client can access the server.

The operation steps are as follows:

1. Make sure ports 6667, 9003, 9004, 40010, 40011 and 31999 are open on all three nodes.
2. Use 'mvn clean package -pl cluster -am -DskipTests' to compile the distributed module.
3. Send the generated package (iotdb-cluster-0.13.0-SNAPSHOT) to all servers.
4. Configure all nodes' seed_nodes in conf/iotdb-cluster.properties as "A_private_ip:9003,B_private_ip:9003,C_private_ip:9003"
5. Configure the internal_ip in conf/iotdb-cluster.properties to be the private_ip of each node.
6. Configure rpc_address in conf/iotdb-engine.properties to be the public_ip of each node.
7. Run sh sbin/start-node.sh on each of the three nodes (or run in the background).
