# Maintenance Command
## FLUSH

Persist all the data points in the memory table of the storage group to the disk, and seal the data file.

```
IoTDB> FLUSH 
IoTDB> FLUSH root.ln
IoTDB> FLUSH root.sg1,root.sg2
```

## MERGE

Execute Level Compaction and unsequence Compaction task. Currently IoTDB supports the following two types of SQL to manually trigger the compaction process of data files:

* `MERGE` Execute the level compaction first and then execute the unsequence compaction. In unsequence compaction process, this command is executed very fast by rewriting the overlapped Chunks only, while there is some redundant data on the disk eventually.
* `FULL MERGE` Execute the level compaction first and then execute the unsequence compaction. In unsequence compaction process, this command is executed slow due to it takes more time to rewrite all data in overlapped files. However, there won't be any redundant data on the disk eventually.

```
IoTDB> MERGE
IoTDB> FULL MERGE
```

## CLEAR CACHE

Clear the cache of chunk, chunk metadata and timeseries metadata to release the memory footprint.

```
IoTDB> CLEAR CACHE
```

## SCHEMA SNAPSHOT

To speed up restarting of IoTDB, users can create snapshot of schema and avoid recovering schema from mlog file.

```
IoTDB> CREATE SNAPSHOT FOR SCHEMA
```


## Timeout

IoTDB supports session and query level timeout.

### Session timeout

Session timeout controls when idle sessions are closed. An idle session is one that had not initiated any query or non-query operations for a period of time.

Session timeout is disabled by default and can be set using the `session_timeout_threshold` parameter in IoTDB configuration file.

### Query timeout

For queries that take too long to execute, IoTDB will forcibly interrupt the query and throw a timeout exception, as shown in the figure: 

```
IoTDB> select * from root;
Msg: 701 Current query is time out, please check your statement or modify timeout parameter.
```

The default timeout of a query is 60000 ms，which can be customized in the configuration file through the `query_timeout_threshold` parameter.

If you use JDBC or Session, we also support setting a timeout for a single query（Unit: ms）：

```
E.g. ((IoTDBStatement) statement).executeQuery(String sql, long timeoutInMS)
E.g. session.executeQueryStatement(String sql, long timeout)
```

If the timeout parameter is not configured or with value 0, the default timeout time will be used.

### Query abort

In addition to waiting for the query to time out passively, IoTDB also supports stopping the query actively:

```
KILL QUERY <queryId>
```

You can abort the specified query by specifying `queryId`. If `queryId` is not specified, all executing queries will be killed.

To get the executing `queryId`，you can use the `show query processlist` command，which will show the list of all executing queries，with the following result set：

| Time | queryId | statement |
| ---- | ------- | --------- |
|      |         |           |

The maximum display length of statement is 64 characters. For statements with more than 64 characters, the intercepted part will be displayed.
