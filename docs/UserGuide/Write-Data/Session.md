# Native API Write
The Native API ( Session ) is the most widely used series of APIs of IoTDB, including multiple APIs, adapted to different data collection scenarios, with high performance and multi-language support.

## Multi-language API write
* ### Java
    Before writing via the Java API, you need to establish a connection, refer to [Java Native API](../API/Programming-Java-Native-API.md).
    then refer to [ JAVA Data Manipulation Interface (DML) ](../API/Programming-Java-Native-API.md#insert)

* ### Python
    Refer to [ Python Data Manipulation Interface (DML) ](../API/Programming-Python-Native-API.md#insert)

* ### C++ 
    Refer to [ C++ Data Manipulation Interface (DML) ](../API/Programming-Cpp-Native-API.md#insert)

* ### Go
    Refer to [Go Native API](../API/Programming-Go-Native-API.md)
