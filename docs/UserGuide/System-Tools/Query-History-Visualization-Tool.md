## Query History Visualization Tool

IoTDB Query History Visualization Tool uses a monitoring web page to provide metrics service for viewing the query history and SQL execution time. It also provides the memory and CPU usage of the current host.

The port of IoTDB Query History Visualization Tool is `8181`. Just print your `ip:8181` in your browser, and the page view looks like this:
