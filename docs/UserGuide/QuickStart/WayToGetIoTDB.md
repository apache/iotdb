## Way to get IoTDB binary files

IoTDB provides you three installation methods, you can refer to the following suggestions, choose one of them:

* Installation from source code. If you need to modify the code yourself, you can use this method.
* Installation from binary files. Download the binary files from the official website. This is the recommended method, in which you will get a binary released package which is out-of-the-box.
* Using Docker：The path to the dockerfile is https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile

### Prerequisites

To use IoTDB, you need to have:

1. Java >= 1.8 (Please make sure the environment path has been set)
2. Maven >= 3.6 (Optional)
3. Set the max open files num as 65535 to avoid "too many open files" problem.

>Note: If you don't have maven installed, you should replace 'mvn' in the following commands with 'mvnw.sh' or 'mvnw.cmd'.
>
>### Installation from  binary files

You can download the binary file from:
[Download page](https://iotdb.apache.org/Download/)

### Installation from source code

You can get the released source code from https://iotdb.apache.org/Download/, or from the git repository https://github.com/apache/iotdb/tree/master
You can download the source code from:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/iotdb.git
```

Under the root path of iotdb:

```
> mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Then the binary version (including both server and client) can be found at **distribution/target/apache-iotdb-{project.version}-bin.zip**

> NOTE: Directories "thrift/target/generated-sources/thrift" and "antlr/target/generated-sources/antlr4" need to be added to sources roots to avoid compilation errors in IDE.

If you would like to build the IoTDB server, you can run the following command under the root path of iotdb:

```
> mvn clean package -pl server -am -DskipTests
```

After build, the IoTDB server will be at the folder "server/target/iotdb-server-{project.version}". 

### Installation by Docker (Dockerfile)

Apache IoTDB' Docker image is released on [https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iotdb](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iotdb),
Using `docker pull apache/iotdb:latest` can get the latest docker image.

Users can also build a docker image themselves.

Now a Dockerfile has been written at docker/src/main/Dockerfile.

1. You can build a docker image by:
```shell
$ docker build -t iotdb:base git://github.com/apache/iotdb#master:docker
```
Or:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/iotdb
$ cd iotdb
$ cd docker
$ docker build -t iotdb:base .
```
Once the docker image has been built locally (the tag is iotdb:base in this example), you are almost done!

2. create docker volume for data files and logs:
```shell
$ docker volume create mydata
$ docker volume create mylogs
```
3. run a docker container:
```shell
$ docker run -p 6667:6667 -v mydata:/iotdb/data -v mylogs:/iotdb/logs -d iotdb:base /iotdb/bin/start-server.sh
```
If success, you can run `docker ps`, and get something like the following:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES
2a68b6944cb5        iotdb:base          "/iotdb/bin/start-se…"   4 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        0.0.0.0:6667->6667/tcp              laughing_meitner
```
You can use the above command to get the container ID:
```shell
$ docker container ls
```
suppose the ID is <C_ID>.

And get the docker IP by:
```shell
$ docker inspect --format='{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' <C_ID>
```
suppose the IP is <C_IP>.

4. If you just want to have a try by using iotdb-cli, you can:
```shell
$ docker exec -it /bin/bash  <C_ID>
$ (now you have enter the container): /cli/sbin/start-cli.sh -h localhost -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```

Or,  run a new docker container as the client:
```shell
$ docker run -it iotdb:base /cli/sbin/start-cli.sh -h <C_IP> -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```
Or,  if you have a iotdb-cli locally (e.g., you have compiled the source code by `mvn package`), and suppose your work_dir is cli/bin, then you can just run:
```shell
$ start-cli.sh -h localhost -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```
5. If you want to write codes to insert data and query data, please add the following dependence:
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.iotdb</groupId>
            <artifactId>iotdb-jdbc</artifactId>
            <version>0.10.0</version>
        </dependency>
```
Some examples about how to use IoTDB with IoTDB-JDBC can be found at: https://github.com/apache/iotdb/tree/master/example/jdbc/src/main/java/org/apache/iotdb

6. Now enjoy it!
