# 1. work process

## Main link

IoTDB official website：https://iotdb.apache.org/

Code library：https://github.com/apache/iotdb/tree/master

Get started quickly：http://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/master/Get%20Started/QuickStart.html

## Subscribe to mailing list

The mailing list is where the Apache project conducts technical discussions and communication with users. Follow the mailing list to receive mail.

Mailing list address：dev@iotdb.apache.org

Follow method: Send an email to dev-subscribe@iotdb.apache.org with the email you want to receive the email, the subject content is not limited, after receiving the reply, send a confirmation email to the confirmation address again (the confirmation address is longer, it is recommended  gmail mailbox).


Other mailing list:
* notifications@iotdb.apache.org (for JIRA information notification.)
  * If you just want to pay attention to some issues, you do not need to subscribe this mailing list.
  Instead, you just need to click "start-watching this issue" on the jira issue webpage. 
* commits@iotdb.apache.org (for code changes notification. Take care because this mailing list may have many emails)
* reviews@iotdb.apache.org (for code reviews notification on Github.  Take care because this mailing list may have many emails)



## New features, bug feedback, improvements, and more

All features or bugs that you want IoTDB to do can be raised on Jira：https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/IOTDB/issues

You can choose issue types: bug, improvement, new feature, etc.  New issues will be automatically synchronized to the mailing list (notifications@), and subsequent discussions can be left on jira or on the mailing list.  When the issue is resolved, close the issue.

## Email discussion content (English)

* Joining the mailing list for the first time can introduce you briefly.  (Hi, I'm xxx ...)

* Before developing a function, you can send an e-mail to declare the task you want to do.（Hi，I'm working on issue IOTDB-XXX，My plan is ...）

## Contributing documents

The content of all IoTDB official websites is in the docs of the project root directory:

* docs/SystemDesign: System Design Document-English Version
* docs/zh/SystemDesign: System Design Document-Chinese Version
* docs/UserGuide: User Guide English Version
* docs/zh/UserGuide: User Guide Chinese Version
* docs/Community: community English Version
* docs/zh/Community: community Chinese Version
* docs/Development: Development Guide English Version
* docs/zh/Development: Development Guide Chinese Version

Correspondence between versions and branches on the official website:

* In progress -> master
* major_version.x -> rel/major_version （如 0.9.x -> rel/0.9）

Precautions:

* Images in Markdown can be uploaded to https://github.com/thulab/iotdb/issues/543 for url
* Do not use special Unicode chars, e.g., U+FF1A 
* Do not use the character of dollar (as we will use Latex to generate pdf files)

### Code Formatting

We use the [Spotless
plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven) together with [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) to format our Java code. You can configure your IDE to automatically apply formatting on saving with these steps(Take idea as an example):

1. Download the [google-java-format
   plugin v1.7.0.5](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format/versions/stable/83169), it can be installed in IDEA (Preferences -> plugins -> search google-java-format), [More detailed setup manual](https://github.com/google/google-java-format#intellij-android-studio-and-other-jetbrains-ides)
2. Install the plugin from disk (Plugins -> little gear icon -> "Install plugin from disk" -> Navigate to downloaded zip file)
3. In the plugin settings, enable the plugin and keep the default Google code style (2-space indents)
4. Remember to never update this plugin to a later version，until Spotless was upgraded to version 1.8+.
5. Install the [Save Actions
   plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions) , and enable the plugin, along with "Optimize imports" and "Reformat file"
6. In the "Save Actions" settings page, setup a "File Path Inclusion" for `.*\.java`. Otherwise you will get unintended reformatting in other files you edit.
7. Fix the issues of reordering the import packages: in IDEA: choose: Preferences | Editor | Code Style | Java | imports. At the tail of the panel, there is "Import Layout", change it to:
```shell
   import org.apache.iotdb.*
   <blank line>
   import all other imports
   <blank line>
   import java.*
   <blank line>
   import static all other imports
```


## Contributing code

You can go to jira to pick up the existing issue or create your own issue and get it. The comment says that I can do this issue.

* Clone the repository to your own local repository, clone to the local, and associate the apache repository as the upstream upstream repository.
* Cut out a new branch from master. The branch name is determined by the function of this branch. It is usually called f_new_feature (such as f_storage_engine) or fix_bug (such as fix_query_cache_bug).
* Add code style as the root java-google-style.xml in the idea
* Modify the code and add test cases (unit test, integration test)
  * Integration test reference:server/src/test/java/org/apache/iotdb/db/integration/IoTDBTimeZoneIT
* Use `mvn spotless:check` to check the code style and use `mvn spotless:apply` to correct the code style
* Submit a PR, starting with [IOTDB-jira number]
* Email to dev mailing list：(I've submitted a PR for issue IOTDB-xxx [link])
* Make changes based on other people's reviews and continue to update until merged
* close jira issue

## 2. IoTDB debugging method

Recommended Use Intellij idea. ```mvn clean package -DskipTests``` After putting ```antlr/target/generated-sources/antlr4``` and ```thrift/target/generated-sources/thrift``` marked as ```Source Root```。 

* Server main function：```server/src/main/java/org/apache/iotdb/db/service/IoTDB``, Can be started in debug mode
* Cli：```cli/src/main/java/org/apache/iotdb/cli/```，Use Cli for linux and WinCli for windows, you can start directly with the parameter "-h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root"
* Server rpc implementation (mainly used for cli and server communication, generally start interruption point here):```server/src/main/java/org/apache/iotdb/db/service/TSServiceImpl```
  * all jdbc statements：executeStatement(TSExecuteStatementReq req)
  * jdbc query：executeQueryStatement(TSExecuteStatementReq req)	
  * native Write interface：insertRecord(TSInsertRecordReq req)

* Storage engine org.apache.iotdb.db.engine.StorageEngine
* Query engine org.apache.iotdb.db.qp.QueryProcessor


## Frequent Questions when Compiling the Source Code

1. I could not download thrift-* tools, like `Could not get content
org.apache.maven.wagon.TransferFailedException: Transfer failed for https://github.com/jt2594838/mvn-thrift-compiler/raw/master/thrift_0.12.0_0.13.0_linux.exe`

It is due to some network problems (especially in China), you can:

* Download the file from the URL manually;
  * https://github.com/jt2594838/mvn-thrift-compiler/blob/master/thrift_0.12.0_0.13.0_mac.exe
  * https://github.com/jt2594838/mvn-thrift-compiler/raw/master/thrift_0.12.0_0.13.0_mac.exe
* Put the file to thrift/target/tools/
* Re-run maven command like `mvn compile`
