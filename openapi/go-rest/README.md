# Go API Server for iotdbrest

IoTDB Rest API for Grafana, Prometheus, etc..

## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

To see how to make this your own, look here:

[README](https://openapi-generator.tech)


### How to use:

1. run `mvn generate-sources` under the `openapi` module
2. go to `go-rest` module, fix issues that current openapi-generator causes:
  1. `"mime/multipart"` is forget to be imported in `router.go` (target/gen/iotdbrest/router.go)
  2. `github.com/gorilla/mux` should not be imported in `api_default.go` file. (target/gen/iotdbrest/api_default.go)

### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
cd src
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t iotdbrest .
```

Once image is built use
```
docker run --rm -it iotdbrest 
```
