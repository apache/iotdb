/**
 * PipeCollector
 *
 * <p>PipeCollector is responsible for capturing events from sources.
 *
 * <p>Various data sources can be supported by implementing different PipeCollector classes.
 *
 * <p>The lifecycle of a PipeCollector is as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When a collaboration task is created, the KV pairs of `WITH COLLECTOR` clause in SQL are
 *       parsed and the validation method {@link PipeCollector#validate(PipeParameterValidator)}
 *       will be called to validate the parameters.
 *   <li>Before the collaboration task starts, the method {@link
 *       PipeCollector#customize(PipeParameters, PipeCollectorRuntimeConfiguration)} will be called
 *       to config the runtime behavior of the PipeCollector.
 *   <li>Then the method {@link PipeCollector#start()} will be called to start the PipeCollector.
 *   <li>While the collaboration task is in progress, the method {@link PipeCollector#supply()} will
 *       be called to capture events from sources and then the events will be passed to the
 *       PipeProcessor.
 *   <li>The method {@link PipeCollector#close()} will be called when the collaboration task is
 *       cancelled (the `DROP PIPE` command is executed).
 * </ul>
