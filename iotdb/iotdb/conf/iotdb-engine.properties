# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/data).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# Note: If data_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-length), it will be handled as a relative path.

# For this property, multiple directories should be set, and all directories should be separated by ",". All TsFiles will be allocated separately in all these directories. Moreover, setting absolute directories is suggested.
# If this property is unset, system will save the TsFiles in the default relative path directory under the data_dir folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/data/settled).
# If some are absolute, system will save the data in exact location they point to.

# System provides three strategies to choose from, or user can create his own strategy by extending cn.edu.tsinghua.iotdb.conf.directories.strategy.DirectoryStrategy.
# The info of the three strategies are as follows:
# 1. SequenceStrategy: the system will choose the directory in sequence.
# 2. MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose disk has the maximum space.
# 3. MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose folder has the minimum occupied space.
# Set SequenceStrategy,MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy and MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy to apply the corresponding strategy.
# If this property is unset, system will use MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy as default strategy.
# For this property, fully-qualified class name (include package name) and simple class name are both acceptable.
