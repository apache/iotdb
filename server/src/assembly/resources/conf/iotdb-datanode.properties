### Directory Configuration
####################

# system dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/datanode/system).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# dn_system_dir=data\\datanode\\system
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# dn_system_dir=data/datanode/system


# data dirs
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/datanode/data).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# If there are more than one directory, please separate them by commas ",".
# Note: If data_dirs is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# dn_data_dirs=data\\datanode\\data
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# dn_data_dirs=data/datanode/data


# multi_dir_strategy
# The strategy is used to choose a directory from data_dirs for the system to store a new tsfile.
# System provides four strategies to choose from, or user can create his own strategy by extending org.apache.iotdb.db.conf.directories.strategy.DirectoryStrategy.
# The info of the four strategies are as follows:
# 1. SequenceStrategy: the system will choose the directory in sequence.
# 2. MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose disk has the maximum space.
# 3. MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose folder has the minimum occupied space.
# 4. RandomOnDiskUsableSpaceStrategy: the system will randomly choose the directory based on usable space of disks. The more usable space, the greater the chance of being chosen;
# Set SequenceStrategy,MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy and MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy to apply the corresponding strategy.
# If this property is unset, system will use MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy as default strategy.
# For this property, fully-qualified class name (include package name) and simple class name are both acceptable.
# dn_multi_dir_strategy=MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy

# consensus dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/datanode).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in the exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# Note: If consensus_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# dn_consensus_dir=data\\datanode\\consensus
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# dn_consensus_dir=data/datanode/consensus

# wal dirs
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/datanode).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in the exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# If there are more than one directory, please separate them by commas ",".
# Note: If wal_dirs is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# dn_wal_dirs=data\\datanode\\wal
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# dn_wal_dirs=data/datanode/wal

# tracing dir
# Uncomment following fields to configure the tracing root directory.
# For Window platform, the index is as follows:
# dn_tracing_dir=datanode\\tracing
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# dn_tracing_dir=datanode/tracing

# sync dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/datanode).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in the exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# Note: If sync_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
