/**
 * The data which has flushed out may be updated due to the "unsequence data" or deletion. As we
 * cannot assume that all index techniques are able to support data deletion or update, the index
 * framework introduces the concept of "index usability range". In the time range which is marked as
 * "index unusable", the correctness of index's pruning phase is not guaranteed.
 *
 * <p>A natural solution is to put the data in the "index unusable" range into the post-processing
 * phase (or called refinement phase) directly.
 *
 * <p>TODO The IIndexUsable's update due to the "merge" finishing hasn't been taken in account.
