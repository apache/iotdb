/**
 * Simplified Disruptor implementation for IoTDB Pipe
 *
 * <p>This implementation is based on LMAX Disruptor (https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor)
 * and simplified for IoTDB's specific use case in the Pipe module.
 *
 * <p>Key simplifications:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Single event handler support (no complex dependency graphs)
 *   <li>Simplified lifecycle management
 *   <li>Removed wait strategies (using simple sleep-based waiting)
 * </ul>
