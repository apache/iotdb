### RocksDB Configuration
####################

# This configuration takes effect only when the schema engine mode is Rocksdb_based.
# The mode is configured in the 'iotdb-common.properties'(schema_engine_mode=Rocksdb_based).

####################
### Cache Configuration
####################
# A proper cache size can speed up metadata query.You can configure the cache size as required.
# By default, the block cache is calculated based on parameter 'write_read_schema_free_memory_proportion' in 'iotdb-common.properties'.
# Assuming 30GB of memory allocated to the schema, that will allocate 30GB to the following configuration items in proportion.

# Datatype: long
# LRU block cache size. Block cache is where RocksDB caches data in memory for reads.
# The block cache stores uncompressed blocks.
# The default value is 2/3 of the schema memory configured for parameter
# 'write_read_schema_free_memory_proportion' in the 'iotdb-common.properties'.
# For example, if the total configured memory size is 30GB and the schema ratio is 1/10,
# the default value is 30GB * 1/10 * 2/3
# block_cache_size=2147483648

# Datatype: long
# LRU block cache size. Block cache is where RocksDB caches data in memory for reads.
# The block cache stores compressed blocks.
# The default value is 1/3 of the schema memory configured for parameter
# 'write_read_schema_free_memory_proportion' in the 'iotdb-common.properties'.
# For example, if the total configured memory size is 30GB and the schema ratio is 1/10,
# the default value is 30GB * 1/10 * 1/3
# block_cache_compressed_size=1073741824

### Professional Configuration
####################
# The following configuration items may serve professional personnel.
# If there is no special requirement, you can use the default value.

# Datatype: long
# The size of each block. The default is 4 KB.
# block_size=4096

# Datatype: int
# The block size deviation.The default is 5.
# block_size_deviation=5

# Datatype: long
# This is the maximum write buffer size used throughout the database.
# It represents the amount of data to build up in memory (backed by an unsorted log on disk)
# before converting to a sorted on-disk file. The default is 64 KB.
# write_buffer_size=65536

# Datatype: long
# This option applies to the whole database only.
# max_total_wal_size=65536

# Datatype: int
# The max number of background job,it contains compaction tasks and flush tasks.
# The default is 10.
# max_background_job_num=10

# Datatype: double
# The Bloom Filter uses a number of bits for each key,which yields a filter with false positive rate.
# The default is 64.
# bloom_filter_policy=64

# Datatype: int
# Record the interval size of Restart points.The default is 10.
# block_restart_interval=10

# Datatype: int
# The maximum number of memtables, both active and immutable.
# If the active memtable fills up and the total number of memtables is larger
# than max_write_buffer_number rocksdb stall further writes.
# max_write_buffer_num=6
